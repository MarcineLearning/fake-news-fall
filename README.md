# fake-news-fall
This repository contains the code resources as part of the project for the Machine Learning &amp; Pattern Recognition course. The code is developed in Python 3.7 and covers the implementation of different fake news classifiers.

As the repository name itself reveals, the project's focus is all about detecting fake news and confirming good news.
The training relies on two different datasets found on Kaggle.

The classifiers we implemented, trained, and tested, are the following:
  - SVM (linear/non-linear kernels)
  - Logistic Regression
  - KNN
  - Naive Bayes (Bernoulli)
  - Deep Learning (FeedForward, Convolutional)
